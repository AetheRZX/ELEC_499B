    "Optimization:\n",
    "- To have the benefits of both MTPA and MTPV, the controller should allow MTPA for low-speed range and MTPV at high speed. \n",
    "- 120 deg commutation has non-complementary switching (this means that for 60 degrees, the two transistors are not opposite values. i.e. when the phase current is off, both transistors are off). Stator inductance causes delay in changing the phase current to zero, goes to zero at time depending on machines time constant and operating conditions. \n",
    "- For MTPA, we want $i_d$ to be zero (only quadrature axis current contributes to torque). For hall-effect BLDC, can use a PI controller to fix current to zero -> tradeoff is increased complexity with high-order filter -> need computationally efficient method\n",
    "- MTPV. This is implemented either with analytical approximations or lookup tables (LUT). Values are tabulated from simulations or experiments. LUTs remove computational burden on microprocessors\n",
