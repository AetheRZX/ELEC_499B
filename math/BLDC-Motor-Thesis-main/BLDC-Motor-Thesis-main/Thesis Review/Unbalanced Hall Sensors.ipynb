    "### Introduction:\n",
    "- Assumption that Hall sensors are placed 120 electrical degrees apart not necessarily true in low-cost machines. \n",
    "- Imbalanced sensors leads to torque ripple, acoustic noise, vibrations and degredation of overall performance. \n",
    "- Averaging of time intervals is proposed to improve steady-state operation. MIMO filter is placed between hall signals and switching logic. "
