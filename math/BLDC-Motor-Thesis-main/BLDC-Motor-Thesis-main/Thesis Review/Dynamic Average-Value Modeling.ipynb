    "### Average-Value Modeling:\n",
    "- This is a model where the effects fo fast switching are neglected relative to very slow dynamic behaviour of the system (i.e. long time constants) and are replaced eith average values.\n",
    "- These models are continuous\n",
    "- Reduces computation requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### BLDC Inverter System:\n",
    "- Consists of permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) driven by voltage source inverter (VSI).\n",
    "- This paper examines inverter with 120deg commutation method\n",
    "- 120deg commutation involves the phase being open-circuited for a small fraction of the revolution.\n",
    "- Original modeling was an average-value model (AVM) with sinusoidal back EMF. "

    "- Uses trapezoidal back EMF harmonics.\n",
    "- 120deg commutation scheme with 30deg advanced firing angle\n",
    "- Flux linkage vector will look like a square wave -> Fourier transform can decompose this into sum of sine waves (harmonics). Usually just the first harmonic is included. \n",
    "- Includes 5th, and 7th harmonics. (only odd harmonics exist, 3rd harmonic has no effect on averaging process)\n",
    "- Including extra harmonics lead to increased accuracy in the model. "
