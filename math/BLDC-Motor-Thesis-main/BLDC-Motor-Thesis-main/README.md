# BLDC-Motor-Thesis

Repo contains simulation and notes for thesis on BLDC motors. The thesis focusses on mitigating impacts of misalignment on hall effect sensors. 

### MATLAB:
- Model for BLDC motors in QD coordinates.
- Models with ideal and misaligned hall sensors to compare impact of misalignment

### Thesis Review:
- Notes from literature review on BLDC motors
